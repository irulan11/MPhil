# MPhil

This repository is the culmination of my Master of Philosophy (Data Science) degree. It contains all relevant code required to reproduce results in my thesis. 

### Data 

Due to memory constraints, I am unable to include data in this repository. Code used to obtain this data has been included in Scraping and Cleaning Data.ipynb and allows you to generate and clean the data if required. Alternatively, email me at irulan.murphy@gmail.com if you wish to have access to the cleaned CSV/pickle files used. 

### irulan.py
... is a Python script containing useful functions. Most Jupyter notebooks in this repository rely on functions from here.
