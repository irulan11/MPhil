# MPhil

This repository is the culmination of my Master of Philosophy (Data Science) degree. It contains all relevant code required to reproduce results in my thesis. 

### Data 

For simplicity (and so this doesn't contain thousands of unnecessary data sets!), I have only included cleaned data in this repository. This is the data required to run the exploratory data analysis, topic modelling, and sentiment analysis. Code used to obtain this data has been included and allows you to geneate the raw data if required. Alternatively, email me if you wish to have access to the raw CSV files used.
